aNetHack is designed to be built on UNIX速-based systems.  The developer will attempt to make aNetHack available for as many systems as possible, but makes not guarantees as to aNetHack's efficacy on Windows速 or Mac速.

Required packages for compiling

* A working C compiler (I reccomend Clang or GCC)
* The GNU version of make
* Flex
* Bison
* The curses development library (optional, but program files require editing if you want to not install this).

Thanks to Edoardo Spadolini, we have a "GNUmakefile", which makes it much easier to compile.  If all required packages are installed, then simply running "make install" as root in the top-level directory should do everything you want it to in any modern Unix速 based system (and Mac?  Someone please test this).  If you have any problems, contact me.
