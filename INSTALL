Thanks to kerio and GNU, we have a "GNUmakefile", which makes it a breeze to compile.  In order to compile, you need the GNU version of make, a working c compiler (I reccomend clang or gcc), flex, bison, and a the curses library.  These should be fairly straightforward to install using your system's default package manager.  Then, as root, type "make install", and everything should be where it's supposed to!
