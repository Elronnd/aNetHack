This project is now defunct.  I have moved on to Slash'EM Extended (https://github.com/SLASHEM-Extended/SLASHEM-Extended).  I will be keeping this repo up pretty much indefinitely, though, because I don't believe in linkrot.  You may be interested in fnethack (https://github.com/maurisvh/fnethack), which was (I assume) inspired by aNetHack, although it seems to have ceased development as well.
