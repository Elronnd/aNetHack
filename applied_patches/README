This directory contains a list all of the original patches applied to this variant in their original form.  Some of them to be applied manually, as they did not apply cleanly,  but those diffs are not present.  Currently applied patches:

* The dungeon overview patch.  Recalls previous aspects of the dungeon for you.  Added commands #annotate and #overview.  For a more detailed description, see README.overview

* The Elbereth status line patch.  If you are currently standing on an Elbereth square, show "Elbereth" in the status line.  Works with statuscolors, so you can do something like "STATUSCOLOR=elbereth:green" in your config.

* The arkenstone patch.  Adds an arkenstone with various properties.  Dwarf lords and kings are occasionally carrying it.  For more information, see README.arkenstone.

* The convict patch.  Adds a new role, the convict.  For more information, see README.convict.

* The Brad's pit patch.  Makes a pit called Brad's pit, with "Brad's" engraved on the bottom.  You get +1 luck the first time you fall down it.

* The grudge patch, with the UnNetHack modifications.  Makes various monsters that should be hostile to each other attack each other

* The darkroom patch.  Makes explored, but dark areas a different color than unexplored areas.
